# Charity-Website
People have things like cloths, books etc. which they use for a limited amount of time period.  When time passes, they buy new things and throw/dispose old things.  So our website will provide a platform to the people who want to giveaway those old things to needy people. People will tell what they want to donate & give address from where our volunteer will pick up the things. And then they will give it to needy people.

In corona time, there was too much shortage of Oxygen and people were unable to get the oxygen. So, our website will also help to find where is a good amount of oxygen, so people can check out that hospital.

And because, this is some kind of helping work, we decided the title as HELP.  

I have used technologies HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4 and PHP and MySQL to create this website
